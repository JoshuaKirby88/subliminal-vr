App for flashing subliminal messages

A VR app for Meta Quest that tests the user’s ability to receive information subliminally without being aware of it, by flashing messages at below the liminal level (roughly 40 milliseconds) and then testing ability to guess which of 3 messages was shown.

When the app boots up, the user is presented with a settings screen, with these settings: 1) slider to set the length of time that the message is displayed (between 15 and 200ms)
2) selector to set the background, with the options “Black void”, “White void”, “Landscape” and “Complex”. 
3)selector to set the message display type, with the options “Black void, white letters”, “White void, black letters”, “No change, black letters” and “No change, white letters”
4) slider to select number of times to display message, between 1 and 10 5) Start button When the start button is pressed, the menu fades out, and switches to whichever background was selected. (The backgrounds are a skybox.)
After a random amount of time (between 4 and 7 seconds), the background switches to the preselected one, and a short message (up to 10 characters) is displayed in giant bold font in the middle of the visual field (fixed to the user’s head), for the length of time specified. Then it switches back to the initial background. After a pause (4-7 seconds), this repeats, for the number of times specified. Then three giant buttons are shown, with three different messages - the previously displayed message and two others - and the user can use the pointer to click the one they think was shown to them. 
Then the display returns to the initial settings menu, and a message appears to tell the user if they were correct or not.
